,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3) Weeks run from Monday to Sunday and are based on the ISO8601 international standard for week numbering. Note that weeks at the beginning and end of a year can overlap with the previous and subsequent year, so counts may not sum to annual totals published elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4) Deaths where codes U0701 or U0702 are mentioned on the death certificate according to the WHO International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
