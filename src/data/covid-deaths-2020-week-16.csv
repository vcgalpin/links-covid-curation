Footnotes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1) Figures are provisional and subject to change.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2) Figures are based on date of registration.  In Scotland deaths must be registered within 8 days although in practice, the average time between death and registration is around 3 days.  More information on days between occurrence and registration can be found on the NRS website.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3) Weeks run from Monday to Sunday and are based on the ISO8601 international standard for week numbering. Note that weeks at the beginning and end of a year can overlap with the previous and subsequent year, so counts may not sum to annual totals published elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4) Deaths where codes U07.1 or U07.2 are mentioned on the death certificate according to the WHO International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5) Figures include non-residents.  Deaths are allocated to area based on the usual residence of the deceased.  If the deceased was not a Scottish resident, the death is allocated to the area where the death occurred.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6) Other institutions include clinics, medical centres, prisons and schools.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
